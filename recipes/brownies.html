    <h3>Description: </h3>
    <p>This easy brownie recipe takes about 30 minutes to make from start to finish for a chocolaty treat!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar: </strong>These easy brownies start with two cups of white sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour: </strong>All-purpose flour creates structure in the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter: </strong>Two sticks of melted butter give the brownies moisture and richness.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs: </strong>Eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they help bind the batter together.</li>
        <li><strong>Cocoa powder: </strong>Of course, you'll need cocoa powder for chocolate brownies!</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla: </strong>Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the brownies.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder: </strong>Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the <br> brownies rise.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Salt: </strong>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Walnuts: </strong>Nuts are optional, of course, but they add a welcome crunch.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How to Make Brownies:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.</li>
        <li>Mix sugar, flour, melted butter, eggs, cocoa powder, vanilla, baking powder, and <br>
            salt in a large bowl until combined. Spread the batter into the prepared pan. <br>
            Decorate with walnut halves.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away <br>
