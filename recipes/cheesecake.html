    <h4>Ingredients: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Graham Cracker Crumbs: </strong>A graham cracker crust is the base of this easy <br>
            cheesecake recipe. Crush whole graham crackers or purchase pre-crushed <br>
             crumbs at the store.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter: </strong>Melted butter holds the crust together while adding rich flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar: </strong>You'll need 1 ¼ cups sugar, divided — ¼ cup for <br>
            the crust, 1 cup for the filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Cheese: </strong> Allow the cream cheese to come to room temperature <br>
            before making the filling. If you don't have time, you can soften it quickly by <br>
             beating it or microwaving it in short intervals.</li>
        <li><strong>Sour Cream: </strong>One cup of sour cream adds richness, tanginess, and <br>
            complexity to this perfect cheesecake recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla: </strong>Two teaspoons of vanilla adds flavor and brings out <br>
             the subtle flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs: </strong>Three whole eggs ensure a smooth, creamy, thick cheesecake filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Pie Filling (Optional): </strong>Top this cheesecake with canned pie filling for a restaurant-worthy finish.</li>
    </ul>
